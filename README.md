same as last time, my code will not yet work in the main code area, as RyansDegreeScraper has it's own main. 
changes:
Webscraper feature enhanced, now scrapes ALL degrees from ALL departments from the WSU general catalog (ALL campuses)
new feature: can now save degree data using a list of degrees, degrees are either major or minor, both have a description string + their own attributes.
