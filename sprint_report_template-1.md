# Sprint 1 Report

## What's New (User Facing)
 * CPTS Courses
 * CPTS degree
 * UI for degree manager

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
Some of the things we have accomplished are seeing what is possible with webscrapping and how we can optimize it so we donâ€™t have a lot of wait time between loading the info as well as getting it displayed. For the UI it was a working demo of what can be done as we had to change it last minute due to not being able to use WPF and having to learn blazor. Another thing we learned was coding in C# as this was our first time and although there was a learning curve we were able to use our previous knowledge to pick it up pretty quick, the struggle point was with selenium and the wsu websites formatting which we overcame by going step by step until we got both the courses for CPTS as well as the degree for it as well loading in perfectly.
## Unfinished Work
We did not have much Unfinished work as with this first sprint we wanted to make a proof of concept to see what we can and cant do and build from that point although for the courses it went past us to make a dictionary during the time so it will be implemented into the next sprint. We have also not merged with the code to work together so currently they are all running independently instead of together

 ## Incomplete Issues/User Stories
 Here are links to issues we worked on but did not complete in this sprint:
 
 * URL of issue 1: https://github.com/gudino27/Virtual-Counselor/issues/13 <<Working on the other issues such as smart search, parsing and scraping, which are have higher priority by the way took a lot of time than expected so we did not get to this specific issue as soon as we wanted to.>>
 * URL of issue 2: https://github.com/gudino27/Virtual-Counselor/issues/3 <<We did not get into this issue because it has lower priority compared to the ones we have completed so far.>>
 * URL of issue 3: https://github.com/gudino27/Virtual-Counselor/issues/5 <<We did not get into this issue because it has lower priority compared to the ones we have completed so far.>>

 * URL of issue 6: https://github.com/gudino27/Virtual-Counselor/issues/8 <<We decided that the feature did not add sufficient value for us to work on it in this sprint since working on it assume all the other features are already implemented and working well, which is not the case.>>

## Retrospective Summary
Here's what went well:
  * UI is working 
  * Courses as well as Degree search is currently running fast
  * Smart search works as intended
 
Here's what we'd like to improve:
   * we would like to add more pages to the UI
   * Load in all the courses currently available for pullman spring 2025
   * load in more degrees
   * For the smart search feature, we want to make it more exhaustive so that it can show the user not just the UCORE classes they may need
  
Here are changes we plan to implement in the next sprint:
   * we would like to add more pages to the UI
   * Load in all the courses currently available for pullman spring 2025
   * load in more degrees
